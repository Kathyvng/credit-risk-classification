# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting loan risk. The goal is to classify loans as either low-risk (0) or high-risk (1) based on financial data. The dataset includes features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The analysis follows key machine learning stages: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The primary algorithm used is LogisticRegression, but other models may also be considered for comparison.

## Results

Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression

Accuracy: [Insert Accuracy Score]

Precision: [Insert Precision Score for 0 and 1]

Recall: [Insert Recall Score for 0 and 1]

Additional Observations: [Any notable insights]

## Summary

The best-performing model is determined based on accuracy, precision, and recall scores. If one model consistently outperforms the others, it is recommended for use. However, if predicting high-risk loans (1) is more critical, recall for 1 should be prioritized. If no model meets acceptable performance standards, adjustments like resampling or feature engineering may be needed. The final recommendation depends on the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives in loan risk prediction.
